/*

Convert can-utils/candump output format to the analyzer's RAWFORMAT_PLAIN input format.

Many Linux distributions now implement SocketCAN support and further include
the can-utils for monitoring and exercising CAN bus interfaces.

Further info re: SocketCAN and the can-utils can be viewed here...

Version 4.0.6 of candump was used to develop this converter.
