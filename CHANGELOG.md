## [Unreleased]

### Minor schema change

The XML schema has promoted LookupEnumeration MaxValue from 'int' to 'long' because there are two lookups that use four bytes, the maximum unsigned value of that is not a valid int.

### Fixed

- #550: FUSION_REPEAT_STATUS and FUSION_SETTING Lookup Enumerations have MaxValue of 0
- n2kd: Fix secondary key determination when multiple { } values are present
- n2kd: Fix secondary key determination for PGN 60928
- n2kd: Do not request product information for a stuck device whenever it sends a PGN
- #564: PGN 128520 field 'Track Status' is not a bit lookup
- #563: PGN 65240 field 'Manufacturer Code' should not have a unit
- #554: Fix print of geo positions in DMS format

### Added

- #555: Add Magenta colour to SIMNET_MODE_COLOR.
- #556: Fusion updates
- #558: Fusion updates



## [v6.0.1]

### Fixed

- undo incomplete primary key update to n2kd making it not use any key.

## [v6.0.0]

### Explicity garantuee on Id values

PGN field names have been left the same as in v5.1.3, and only two fallback PGN ids have been changed.

From this point forward, we will garantuee that the <Id> values do not change.
We shall be making improvements to the <Name> values.

Therefore, all downstream consumers are urged to make sure they match on PGN Id and field Id, not name.

### Changed

This is a major upgrade because the old v1 xml and json files are no longer being
supplied.

This is a minor upgrade because there is a new interesting field added to the XML,
`PartOfPrimaryKey` which is a boolean attribute; any field carrying this (have the
field present with a `true` value) contributes to the _Primary key_ of the data --
e.g. any message with a different primary key is from a different source. Fields
like `Source Id`, `Message Id` or `Instance` will have this set to true.

Also, in n2kd `-json -nv` mode and in text mode all fields that refer to a PGN will explain
the meaning of the PGN value (if it is not a proprietary PGN number.)

Also, in n2kd `json -nv` mode any NAME fields that occur (so far, only in the Alerts PGNs)
will contain in the `name:` attribute a recursive expansion of the fields contained
in that single NAME field. These subfields are the same fields as described in PGN
60928 (Address Claim.)

Further possibly breaking changes in the definitions:

  * PhysicalQuantity:
    * GEOGRAPHICAL_COORDINATE has been split into GEOGRAPHICAL_LATITUDE and GEOGRAPHICAL_LONGITUDE.
    * SIGNAL_STRENGTH has been added.
    * DURATION has been added.
  * FieldType
    * PGN, ISO_NAME, DURATION have been added. They are specialisations of NUMBER, BINARY and TIME, which is what they were before.
    * Navico specific: fieldtype FIELDTYPE_LOOKUP is now named DYNAMIC_FIELD_LOOKUP. KEY_VALUE is now named DYNAMIC_FIELD_VALUE.
      Fieldtype DYNAMIC_FIELD_LENGTH has been added.
  * PGN
    * Fusion PGNs have been reworked.
    * PrimaryKey attribute has been added.
    * Many missing attributes such as priority have been added.
    * Fields have moved from being a plain NUMBER to LOOKUP because the lookup values are now known.
  * PGN names
    * PGN fallback 59392 is now correctly named 0xe8000xee00StandardizedSingleFrameAddressed instead 
      of 0xe8000xeeffStandardizedSingleFrameAddressed (note the ff -> 00 change).
    * PGN fallback 126720 is now correctly named 0x1ef000ManufacturerProprietaryFastPacketAddressed
      instead of 0x1ef000x1efffManufacturerProprietaryFastPacketAddressed.
  * PGN fields
    * Fusion PGNs have been reworked.

## [5.0.0]

Note: Changes to XML v2 (canboat.xml, canboat.xsd, canboat.xsl) so this will
constitute a new major release. The changes are small, the schema for canboat.xsd
has been bumped to 2.1. The differences are:
  - Dynamic field types, where a (repeating) set of fields defines a varying 
    field, can now have a 'lookup' as well. 
  - Some fields have changed from signed to unsigned.

To see the changes, use:

    git diff v4.12.0 docs/canboat.xml
    git diff v4.12.0 docs/canboat.xsd

### Added

- #413: docs: RangeMax for ENTERTAINMENT_PLAY_STATUS_BITFIELD is incorrect

## [4.12.0]

### Fixed

- #396: Add missing Fusion message ID loopup value
- #395: Altitude in PGN 129798 (SAR AIS) should be 32 bits
- #394: v1 type for `STRING_LZ` is incorrect

### Added

## [4.11.1]

### Fixed

### Added

## [4.11.0]

### Fixed
- End all logAbort messages with a newline.

- #391: Incorrect field sizes for PGN 129285.
- #393: Make sure single frame PGNs are 8 bytes and all PGNs fill the last byte.
        This actually found a few small bugs in PGNs:
        PGN 128778: Field length for Controller Voltage was incorrect.
        PGN 126802 Airmar 34: Field names were copy/pasted and thus incorrect.
        PGN 129803: Field names changed (but this PGN is not seen yet) to match ITU.
- #387: analyzer: Don't crash when presented with PGN of 0.

### Added
- #385: Allow analyzer to read mixed `RAWFORMAT_PLAIN` and `RAWFORMAT_FAST` input.
        A new `-format <fmt>` option has been added, this new mode is only enabled when
        `-format PLAIN_OR_FAST` is selected.

## [4.10.1]

### Fixed
- #383: Add NMEA 2000 v3.002 PGNs.
- #376: Added Type field to PGN 130571.
- #377: Ensure PGNs are correct framing type (packet type) and fix PGN 130824 B&G Wind Data.

## [4.8.0]

### Added

- #125: Added PGNs 130052 (Loran-C TD Data), 130054 (Loran-C Range Data), and 130054 (Loran-C Signal Data)
- Added fields for PGN 126986 (Alert Configuration) with some field lengths unknown

- Set interval of PGN 130313 (Humidity) to 2000 ms
- More forgiving timeout to suit NGT-1 USB

## [4.7.0]

### Changed

- Format change: `analyzer` now passes the unformatted data for fields such as Date and Time in 
  `{"value":x,"name":"fmt"}` style so downstream code does not need to un-parse these. 
  This is triggered by `-nv` just as it is for lookup fields.
- Format change: `analyzer` output for fields is always `{"fieldname": <object>, ...}` where object
  is either a simple value or a `{ "key": "value", ...}` object that contains at least the key named
  `"value"`.
- `docs/canboat.xml`: PGNInfo element `Fallback` is now a boolean.

### Added

- #337: Add `BitLengthField` element for variable length binary fields.

### Fixed

- #336: PGN 129285 Repeating Field info incorrect.
- #335: UTF16 strings are printed incorrectly.
- #333: Repair decimal fraction printing of Time fields.
- #332: PGNInfo.Fallback should be type 'Boolean'.
- #331: Fix invalid JSON generation by `analyzer` especially when options `-nv` and/or `-debug` were passed.
- Fix regression where end-of-data was not properly handled; caused incomplete data fields to be processed
  incorrectly.

## [4.6.1]

### Fixed

- #328: PGN 129302: Fix field lengths and lookup lists for `Bearing Reference` and `Calculation Type`.
- #326: AIS PGNs now have Enum Message Id, also use this in the ais parser.

## [4.6.0]

### Fixed

- #327: Fix print of MMSI on gcc-8.30/linux-arm7l; cast required to pass correct size on stack.
- #326: Match fields should have lookup enum or be number type.

## [4.5.2]

### Fixed

- Repaired `n2kd_monitor` to pass `-nv` option.
- Improve dependencies on common files in Makefiles.

## [4.5.1]

### Changed

- Added resolution for FLOAT and POWER fields.

### Fixed

- #324: pgns: some fields are missing resolution value

## [4.5.0]

### Changed

- When a PGN contains multiple 'Reserved' or 'Spare' fields the Id has been made unique by
  appending the field order to the Id.
- Several PGN Descriptions and Id have been changed to make them unique.
  Of these, only PGN 130310 is in general use.
  The affected PGNs (with their old names) are:
  - PGN 61184 "Seatalk: Wireless Keypad Control" has been split, with one version dropping the "Control" word.
  - PGN 65325 "Simnet: Reprogram Status" has been removed.
  - PGN 126720 "Fusion: Mute" has been renamed to "Fusion: Set Mute".
  - PGN 130310 "Environmental Parameters" has been renamed to "Environmental Parameters (obsolete)".
  - PGN 130820 "Furuno: Unknown" has been renamed to "Furuno: Unknown 130820"
  - PGN 130821 "Furuno: Unknown" has been renamed to "Furuno: Unknown 130821"
- PGN 129556 "GLONASS Almanac Data" has been improved with URL reference and explanations, as well as slight changes
  to field names causing Id changes.

### Added

- `docs/canboat.xml` now contains `PGN/Fields/Field/LookupIndirectEnumerationFieldOrder`.
- A test has been added to verify that PGN Id and Field Id are unique.

### Removed

- `docs/canboat.xml` no longer contains `PGN/Fields/Field/LookupIndirectEnumerationField`.

### Fixed

- #323: Generate unique 'Id' elements for PGNs.
- #322: Generate Order for IndirectEnumeration lookups.
- #321: Generate unique 'Id' elements for fields.

## [4.4.0]

### Changed

- `n2kd` must now be fed by `analyzer -json -nv` so that it does not need to reverse the lookup numbers
  for NMEA0183 streams. It does mean that anything with a lookup value is now presented differently to
  any JSON clients. This means the protocol has changed, requiring another version bump.
- String fields that contain different 'filler' characters at the end, for instance both 'space', '@' and
  0xff will be shrunk until all such characters are removed, not just the sequence of same type fillers.

### Fixed

- #320: Update AIS lookups according to ITU M.1371-5
- #319: analyzer: fixup printing of lookup values for `-json -nv` that have no entry in the lookup table.
- #318: n2kd: NMEA0183 streams for AIS will now log errors when AIS data field names are changed,
        lookup values are extracted by number -- see above for new restriction

## [4.3.0]

### Added

- #317: Add `INDIRECT_LOOKUP` fieldtype, and XML/JSON that enumerates `EnumTriplet`s.
        This is used for enumerating DEVICE_FUNCTION, which depends on the DEVICE_CLASS,
        as used in PGNs 60928 "ISO Address Claim" and 65240 "ISO Commanded Address".

### Fixed

- #317: PGN 127489 Dynamic Engine Parameters field Percent Engine Torque is signed, not unsigned.
- #316: Regression since v2.0.0: Temperature Coefficient was dropped from PGN 127513.
- #315: Remove superfluous duplicate fallback PGN.
- Fix `RangeMax` for UINT64_MAX values.
- Fix print of bitlookup in textual analyzer.

## [4.2.2]

### Fixed

- Add/fix `RangeMin` and `RangeMax` for fields with `Offset`.
- Fix makefiles & version permeation.
- Add external documentation section.

## [4.2.1]

### Changed

- Add documentation on the fields in `canboat.xml` in `canboat.xsd`. 
  These are useful for downstream interpreters of the file.
- Make `n2kd` emit a request for PGN 126996 (Product Info) if a source 
  is found that it doesn't have product info for. This allows it to use the
  secondary keys properly, and downstream users can create device -> src mappings.
- `ikonvert-serial` will now send $PDGY strings on stdin to the iKonvert.
  This is useful in debugging scenarios.

## [4.2.0]

### Changed

- XML v2 (`canboat.xml` + `canboat.json`) changes:
  - Added LOOKUP and BITLOOKUP as base field types in the FieldList. This means they
    are easily recognised (they are no longer a NUMBER).
  - Emit `Resolution` even when it is 1. Only stringy and bitfield types now do not have a resolution.
  - Emit `LookupEnumeration` even for fields that have a `Match`.
- XML v2 `canboat.xsl` changes:
  - Show offset for number fields and add textual explanation.

### Fixed

- #283: Further improvements to v2 JSON/XML


## [4.1.0]

### Changed

- Reduce the types of fields reported in the XML and JSON to the base types. A parser needs
  a 'parser' for each FieldType, and each will be different. Copy some attributes to field
  level in the XML. Internally the derived fieldtypes are still used.
- Add an orthogonal `PhysicalQuantity` type in the canboat.xml,json that explains what is stored in the field.
- Cleaner field lists in `canboat.xsl`.

### Fixed

- #311: Fix regression in 4.0.0: PGN 126996 Version field length
- #310: Resolution of field should match field type
- #283: Further improvements to v2 JSON/XML


## [4.0.0]

### Changed

- The default `make` target on top level is now to only build the binaries, not the 
  generated files. This is seems more appropriate for most users.
  Use `make generated` to update all generated files.
- The generated `pgns-v2` files (`.xml` and `.json`) added in 3.0.0 are moved to the
  `docs` subdirectory and renamed to `canboat`.
  They are now accompanied by:
  - `canboat.xsl` for rendering `canboat.xml` in a webbrowser. This is now the main
    documentation page for humans on how the PGN list is built up.
  - `canboat.css` for helping in rendering `canboat.xml` in a webbrowser.
  - `canboat.dtd` for validating `canboat.xml`.
- The older `pgns.xml` and `pgns.json` files are, as much as possible, unchanged but there are still some (breaking) changes:
  - The `RepeatingFields` element was imprecise and was not able to cover all types and manners of repetition, and has been replaced
    by up to six elements.
    `RepeatingFieldSet1Size`
    `RepeatingFieldSet1StartField`
    `RepeatingFieldSet1CountField` (only present if there is a field that contains the number of repetitions, otherwise boundless)
    `RepeatingFieldSet2Size`
    `RepeatingFieldSet2StartField`
    `RepeatingFieldSet2CountField` (only present if there is a field that contains the number of repetitions, otherwise boundless)
  - All fields now have a `Type`.
  - PGN fields no longer have a description `PGN` (which added no value as the field name is also `PGN`.
  - PGN 60416 "ISO Transport Protocol, Connection Management - End Of Message" field id "totalNumberOfPacketsReceived" is now
    "totalNumberOfFramesReceived".
  - The `MissingAttribute` named `Precision` is now named `Resolution` as that is the field attribute that it refers to that is
    missing or uncertain.
  - Power factor fields now have a proper `Resolution` (6.10352e-5) and `Units` attribute.
  - Non-matching ''Manufacturer code'' fields now have a list of manufacturers.
  - Where `Resolution` is 0 it is never output (instead of "usually not".)
  - Small resolutions are now printed in `%g` format not `%f`, so exponential notation is used -- for example `1e-07` instead of
    `0.0000001`.
- The JSON generated by `analyzer` has the following changes and fixes:
  - The '-debug' option now implies the "-nv" option, and "-debug -json" will print the data bytes or bits as hex bytes
    for every field. This makes it very easy to correlate the field with the source data.
  - shorter binary fields were incorrectly printed as a string contain decimal number. They are now printed as a
    space separated sequence of two uppercase hex digits.
  - longer binary fields are now printed the same as above, with uppercase instead of lowercase and no trailing space.
  - Some fields have changed from being a 'number' to a 'time', causing them to be formatted as `hh:mi:ss[.milli]`.
    These are:
    - PGN 126993 "Heartbeat" field "Data transmit offset"
    - PGN 127489 "Engine Parameters, Dynamic" field "Total engine hours"
  - Some fields that are really a number are now correctly printed as a number and not as a string:
    - PGN 60928 "ISO Address Claim" field "Unique Number"
  - Empty string fields are now considered 'null', so are only output in json format when -empty is passed.
  - MMSI fields are now a string, and always 9 digits long (so base stations start with "00").
  - PGN 65408 "Airmar: Depth Quality Factor" now contains a lookup for Depth Quality Factor.
  - PGN 130836 "Maretron Proprietary Switch Status Counter" renamed to "Maretron: Switch Status Counter".
  - PGN 130837 "Maretron Proprietary Switch Status Timer" renamed to "Maretron: Switch Status Timer" and
    period fields changed from "decimal" to "time".
- The algorithm for recombining frames into a full fast-packet PGN has been refactored. It now handles out-of-order
  data as produced by the YDGW-02. Some tests have been added to verify that this works.

### Fixed

- #305: Print reserved fields only when they are not all ones.
- #304: Print spare fields only when they are not all zeroes.
- #303: Allow lookups to use the values for "Error" and "Unknown".
- #302: Field type has changed for `PGNs[].Fields[].Match` in pgn JSON/XML.
- #298: Lookup values should say "Temperature", not just "Temp".
- #293: Unify field names for "RAIM", "AIS RAIM Flag" and "AIS RAIM flag" as "RAIM".
- #292: Reactive power unit is "VAR", not "var".
- #291: Units should never contain "seconds".
- #289: Unify spelling of "Repeat Indicator" to have capital I.
- #267: Print User ID as string field, always with 9 digits.
- #283: Enumerations in pgns-v2.json use names for all attributes.
- #285: Fix `SHORT_TIME` field printing incorrect values.

## [3.1.0]

### Added

- #279: Added value 15 'Shaft Seal Temperature' to `TEMPERATURE_SOURCE` lookup.

### Changed

- #282: Lookup table values should be numbers, not strings.
- #273: Fix resolutions for PGN 129541 which contain (very small) 2^-n values.
