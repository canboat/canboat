</p><h2> Reverse engineering the NMEA 2000 standardized and manufacturer proprietary data </h2><p>
            In the late 90s a number of marine electronics manufacturers realised that there was a need for a better
            protocol than NMEA 0183, which did not suit larger networks. The result was the NMEA 2000 standard. This
            is based on a CAN bus running at 250.000 kbit/s. It allows up to 250 devices on the same bus, although
            this will probably be overloaded.
          </p><p>
            Unfortunately, the NMEA 2000 standard is using the same "closed" mentality as ISO and other industry standards.
            This is completely different from the world of computing, where all such protocols are open for use by anyone.
            In 2008, as I wanted to interface to my brand new NMEA 2000 interface and show the data on this newfangled device
            called an iPhone, I started reverse engineering the protocol. At the time there was limited info available.
            This has improved over time; interestingly even the NMEA leaks a lot of information that is publicly available.
            For instance the list of PGNs and the field <i>names</i> are available at
            <a href="http://www.nmea.org/Assets/july%202010%20nmea2000_v1-301_app_b_pgn_field_list.pdf">http://www.nmea.org/Assets/july%202010%20nmea2000_v1-301_app_b_pgn_field_list.pdf</a>.
          </p><p>
            This document will provide a human readable explanation of everything we (as there are now over 20 contributors) have 
            learned. Right now some basic concepts are not yet explained, but you will find all PGNs, lookup lists, and data types
            here.
          </p><p>
            If you have data (even if it is just a logfile for a new device) to contribute, please open an issue at
            <a href="https://github.com/canboat/canboat/issues">https://github.com/canboat/canboat/issues</a> or send

          An "Extended 29 bit identifier" CAN frame, as mandated by NMEA 2000, consists of a 39 bit header followed by (up to) 64 data bits. The header bits are:

          <table><thead><tr><th>Bit</th><th>CAN</th><th>ISO 11783</th><th>Notes</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td> 1</td><td>SOF</td><td>SOF </td><td>Start of Frame</td></tr><tr><td> 2</td><td>ID 28</td><td>P 3 </td><td>Priority bit 3</td></tr><tr><td> 3</td><td>ID 27</td><td>P 2 </td><td>Priority bit 2</td></tr><tr><td> 4</td><td>ID 26</td><td>P 1 </td><td>Priority bit 1</td></tr><tr><td> 5</td><td>ID 25</td><td>R 1 </td><td>Reserved bit 1</td></tr><tr><td> 6</td><td>ID 24</td><td>DP  </td><td>Data page</td></tr><tr><td> 7</td><td>ID 23</td><td>PF 8</td><td>PDU format bit 8</td></tr><tr><td> 8</td><td>ID 22</td><td>PF 7</td><td>PDU format bit 7</td></tr><tr><td> 9</td><td>ID 21</td><td>PF 6</td><td>PDU format bit 6</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>ID 20</td><td>PF 5</td><td>PDU format bit 5</td></tr><tr><td>11</td><td>ID 19</td><td>PF 4</td><td>PDU format bit 4</td></tr><tr><td>12</td><td>ID 18</td><td>PF 3</td><td>PDU format bit 3</td></tr><tr><td>13</td><td>SRR  </td><td>SRR </td><td>Substitute Remote Request bit</td></tr><tr><td>14</td><td>IDE  </td><td>IDE </td><td>Identifier Extension bit</td></tr><tr><td>15</td><td>ID 17</td><td>PF 2</td><td>PDU format bit 2</td></tr><tr><td>16</td><td>ID 16</td><td>PF 1</td><td>PDU format bit 1</td></tr><tr><td>17</td><td>ID 15</td><td>PS 8</td><td>PDU specific bit 8</td></tr><tr><td>18</td><td>ID 14</td><td>PS 7</td><td>PDU specific bit 7</td></tr><tr><td>19</td><td>ID 13</td><td>PS 6</td><td>PDU specific bit 6</td></tr><tr><td>20</td><td>ID 12</td><td>PS 5</td><td>PDU specific bit 5</td></tr><tr><td>21</td><td>ID 11</td><td>PS 4</td><td>PDU specific bit 4</td></tr><tr><td>22</td><td>ID 10</td><td>PS 3</td><td>PDU specific bit 3</td></tr><tr><td>23</td><td>ID 9 </td><td>PS 2</td><td>PDU specific bit 2</td></tr><tr><td>24</td><td>ID 8 </td><td>PS 1</td><td>PDU specific bit 1</td></tr><tr><td>25</td><td>ID 7 </td><td>SA 8</td><td>Source Address bit 8</td></tr><tr><td>26</td><td>ID 6 </td><td>SA 7</td><td>Source Address bit 7</td></tr><tr><td>27</td><td>ID 5 </td><td>SA 6</td><td>Source Address bit 6</td></tr><tr><td>28</td><td>ID 4 </td><td>SA 5</td><td>Source Address bit 5</td></tr><tr><td>29</td><td>ID 3 </td><td>SA 4</td><td>Source Address bit 4</td></tr><tr><td>30</td><td>ID 2 </td><td>SA 3</td><td>Source Address bit 3</td></tr><tr><td>31</td><td>ID 1 </td><td>SA 2</td><td>Source Address bit 2</td></tr><tr><td>32</td><td>ID 0 </td><td>SA 1</td><td>Source Address bit 1</td></tr><tr><td>33</td><td>RTR  </td><td>RTR </td><td>Remote Tranmission Request bit</td></tr><tr><td>34</td><td>r 1  </td><td>r 1 </td><td>CAN reserved bit 1</td></tr><tr><td>35</td><td>r 0  </td><td>r 0 </td><td>CAN reserved bit 0</td></tr><tr><td>36</td><td>DLC 4</td><td>DLC 4</td><td>Data Length Code bit 4</td></tr><tr><td>37</td><td>DLC 3</td><td>DLC 3</td><td>Data Length Code bit 3</td></tr><tr><td>38</td><td>DLC 2</td><td>DLC 2</td><td>Data Length Code bit 2</td></tr><tr><td>39</td><td>DLC 1</td><td>DLC 1</td><td>Data Length Code bit 1</td></tr></tbody></table><p>
            For NMEA2000 the "R 1" bit is always 0, but in SAE J1939 it is not. J1939 calls this the "Extended Data Page" (EDP).
            In general, we don't care about these and the interfaces will generally only produce the 29 bits named "ID xx" in the above table. This is called the <i>CAN Id</i>.
          </p><p>
            The source address and priority are easily derived from the above table: they form contiguous bits in the header. But the PGN and destination address are formed from the remaining (29 - 3 - 8) = 18 bits in a convoluted fashion.
            The algorithm is as follows:
            <ul><li>
                Generate the values for PF (8 bits) and PS (8 bits) from their contiguous bits in the header. </li><li>
                Generate a value RDP (2 bits) from the "R 1" and "DP" bits.</li><li>
                If the value for PF is less than 240 (0xF0) this is called "PDU1" format. PS contains the destination address and the PGN is formed by <code>[RDP][PF]00000000</code>.</li><li>
                Otherwise if PF is in range 240 - 255 this is called "PDU2" format. The destination is always 'global' (i.e. address 255) and the PGN is formed by <code>[RDP][PF][PS]</code>.</li></ul>

            Note that this means that all PDU1 PGNs are 256 apart, as their lower 8 bits are always zero. Thus there are much fewer of them.
          </p><h2 id="pgn-ranges">PGN ranges</h2><p>
            There are a number of PGN (Parameter Group Number) ranges. When expressed in decimal the ranges do not make much sense, but in hexadecimal they do -- which is explained above.
            The PGN ranges are divided up by PDU1/PDU2 but also by the fact that there is the need to have manufacture private PGNs, so some blocks have been carved out for this purpose.
            The ranges are:
          </p><table><thead><tr><th>Range Hex</th><th>Range Dec</th><th>PDU</th><th>Step</th><th>Number of possible PGNs</th><th>Use</th><th>Framing</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><a href="#pgn-0">0xE800-0xEE00</a></td><td>59392 - 60928</td><td>PDU1</td><td>256</td><td>7</td><td>ISO 11783 (protocol)</td><td>Single frame</td></tr><tr><td><a href="#pgn-61184">0xEF00</a></td><td>61184</td><td>PDU1</td><td/><td>1</td><td>Manufacturer proprietary</td><td>Single frame</td></tr><tr><td><a href="#pgn-61440">0xF000-0xFEFF</a></td><td>61440 - 65279</td><td>PDU2</td><td>1</td><td>3840</td><td>Standardized</td><td>Single frame</td></tr><tr><td><a href="#pgn-65280">0xFF00-0xFFFF</a></td><td>65280 - 65535</td><td>PDU2</td><td>1</td><td>256</td><td>Manufacturer proprietary</td><td>Single frame</td></tr><tr><td><a href="#pgn-65536">0x1ED00-0x1EE00</a></td><td>126208 - 126464</td><td>PDU1</td><td>256</td><td>2</td><td>Standardized (protocol)</td><td>Single frame</td></tr><tr><td><a href="#pgn-126720">0x1EF00</a></td><td>126720</td><td>PDU1</td><td/><td>1</td><td>Manufacturer proprietary</td><td>Fast packet</td></tr><tr><td><a href="#pgn-126976">0x1F000-0x1FEFF</a></td><td>126976 - 130815</td><td>PDU2</td><td>1</td><td>3840</td><td>Standardized</td><td>Mixed single/fast</td></tr><tr><td><a href="#pgn-130816">0x1FF00-0x1FFFF</a></td><td>130816 - 131071</td><td>PDU2</td><td>1</td><td>256</td><td>Manufacturer proprietary</td><td>Fast packet</td></tr></tbody></table><p><b>Note:</b> There are some missing ranges in the above table: Apparently no PGN is used in range 0x0000-0xE700 or 0x10000-0x1EC00. The reason is not obvious to me. Maybe someone can enlighten us?
          </p><h2 id="packet-framing">Packet framing</h2><p>
            NMEA 2000 messages that are 8 bytes or less can be transmitted in a single CAN frame. For messages of 9 or more bytes there
            is an ISO 11783 defined method called Transport Protocol that can be used to transmit up to 1785 bytes. 
            See <a href="#pgn-60416">PGN 60416</a>. This is <i>not</i> generally used though. What is used
            is an alternative method with less overhead and less complexity for the sender. This is called <i>fast</i> packet framing.
          </p><p>
            In fast packet framing, the first packet contains two protocol bytes and six data bytes. Following packets contain one
            protocol byte and seven data bytes. Up to 32 packets can be used for a single message so the total maxing data length
            is 6 + 31 * 7 = 223 bytes.
            The first byte in all frames contains a sequence counter in the high 3 bits and a frame counter in the lower 5 bits.
            The second byte in the first frame contains the total number of frames that will be sent.
            As there is no way to acknowledge or deny reception, if a message is missed the receiver will have to wait for the next
            transmission of the message.
          </p><p>
            It is unclear to us whether the standard mandates that frames are transmitted in order. According to <a href="https://www.yachtd.com/news/strict_frame_order.html">Yacht Devices</a>
            there are (older?) devices that transmit out-of-order as this is easier to program with certain CAN chips, and various new MFDs ignore out-of-order packet transmissions.
            As of v4.0.0 the CANBoat analyzer program will analyze out-of-order frames, although it means it has to heuristically determine when a packet is complete.

Reception of this PGN may also be used to maintain an address to NAME association table within the receiving device.  The transmission interval may be used by the receiving unit to determine the time-out value for the connection supervision.  The value contained in Field 1 of this PGN reflects the PGN’s current Transmission Interval. Changes to this PGN’s Transmission Interval shall be reflected in Field 1.  The transmission interval can only be changed by using the Request Group Function PGN 126208 with no pairs of request parameters provided. Field 3 of the Request Group Function PGN 126208 may contain values between 1,000ms and 60,000ms.  This PGN cannot be requested by the ISO Request PGN 059904 or Request Group Function PGN 126208. In Request Group Function PGN 126208, setting Field 3 to a value of 0xFFFF FFFF and Field 4 to a value of 0xFFFF: “Transmit now without changing timing variables.” is prohibited.  The Command Group Function PGN 126208 shall not be used with this PGN.  Fields 3 and 4 of this PGN provide information which can be used to distinguish short duration disturbances from permanent failures.

            - Man Overboard Notification</h3><p>The MOB PGN is intended to provide notification from a MOB monitoring system. The included position information may be that of the vessel or the MOB device itself as identified in field “X”, position source. Additional information may include the current state of the MOB device, time of activation, and MOB device battery status.
This PGN may be used to set a MOB waypoint, or to initiate an alert process.
This PGN may be used to command or register a MOB device emitter Ids or other applicable fields in the message with an MOB System or other equipment. If the fields in this PGN are configured over the network, the Command Group Function (PGN 126208) shall be used.
Queries for this PGN shall be requested using either the ISO Request (PGN 059904) or the NMEA Request Group Function (PGN 126208).
A device receiving an ISO (PGN 059904) for this PGN (127233), shall respond by providing as many of these PGNs (127233) as necessary for every MOB Emitter ID that has associated data fields.
If a Request Group Function (PGN 126208) requesting this PGN (127233) is received, the receiving device shall respond in the following manner:
•If no requested fields have been included with the Request Group Function then the response is to return one or more PGNs, just like responding to the ISO Request (PGN 055904) described above.
•If the Request Group Function (PGN 126208) includes the MOB Emitter ID field or MOB Status field, then the response shall be filtered by these fields contained within this request resulting in one or more PGN (127233) responses.
If the MOB Emitter ID requested is not considered a valid MOB Emitter ID by the receiving device, then the appropriate response would be the Acknowledge Group Function (PGN 126208), containing the error state for PGN error code (Field 3) of “0x3 = Access denied.” And the requested MOB Emitter ID field parameter error code (Field 6) of “0x3 = Requested or command parameter out-of- range;”.
The Default update rate of this PGN is autonomous, as it is dependant upon notification rates of MOB devices.</p><p>

                This PGN is believed to be (nearly) fully reverse engineered and seems to work in most practical purposes.
              </p><p>
            This
             fast-packet 
            PGN is
            
              at least 2
            bytes long and contains 12 fields.

            
        The 10 fields starting at field 
        3 
        (with name "Line")
        form repeating set 1. The set is repeated <i>n</i> times, where <i>n</i> is determined by the value of field 
        2

            - Linear Actuator Control/Status</h3><p>Actuator is a broad description of any device that embodies moving an object between two fixed limits, such as raising or lowering an outboard engine assembly. In the context of this PGN, the word "Device" refers to the object being moved. In the case of multiple Actuators per controller, the Actuator Identifier field specifies which Actuator the PGN message is intended for, and all following data fields refer only to that Actuator. This PGN supports manufacturer calibrated systems and retrofit systems where it is impractical for the installer to enter the Maximum Travel distance of the device.</p><p>

    All fields are of one of the following field types.

    <h3 id="ft-NUMBER">NUMBER - Number</h3><p/><p>
            Encoding:
            Binary numbers are little endian. Number fields that use two or three bits use one special encoding, for the maximum value.  When present, this means that the field is not present. Number fields that use four bits or more use two special encodings. The maximum positive value means that the field is not present. The maximum positive value minus 1 means that the field has an error. For instance, a broken sensor. For signed numbers the maximum values are the maximum positive value and that minus 1, not the all-ones bit encoding which is the maximum negative value.</p><p>

            Encoding:
            Each byte represent 2 digits, so 1234 is represented by 2 bytes containing 0x12 and 0x34. A number with an odd number of digits will have 0 as the first digit in the first byte.</p><p>

            Encoding:
            The length of the string is determined by the PGN field definition. Trailing bytes have been observed as '@', ' ', 0x0 or 0xff.</p><h3 id="ft-STRING_LZ">STRING_LZ - A varying length string containing single byte codepoints encoded with a length byte and terminating zero.</h3><p>It is unclear what character sets are allowed/supported. Possibly UTF-8 but it could also be that only ASCII values are supported.</p><p>
            Encoding:
            The length of the string is determined by a starting length byte. It also contains a terminating zero byte. The length byte includes the zero byte but not itself.</p><h3 id="ft-STRING_LAU">STRING_LAU - A varying length string containing double or single byte codepoints encoded with a length byte and terminating zero.</h3><p>It is unclear what character sets are allowed/supported. For single byte, assume ASCII. For UNICODE, assume UTF-16, but this has not been seen in the wild yet.</p><p>
            Encoding:
            The length of the string is determined by a starting length byte. The 2nd byte contains 0 for UNICODE or 1 for ASCII.</p><h3 id="ft-BINARY">BINARY - Binary field</h3><p/><p>

            So in effect the value <i>is</i> signed, but it is stored as an unsigned number where
            the unsigned number n should be interpreted as (n + K). As the offset
            in these definitions is negative, it results in a value that can be negative.
